### Abstract

Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, such as multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically employed in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, whereas unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or identify sub-populations in large cohorts. Through various functional neuroimaging applications, this paper illustrates how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be utilized to perform key analysis steps. Scikit-learn offers a comprehensive set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, making it a versatile tool for studying the brain.
